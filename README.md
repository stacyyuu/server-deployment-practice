- I followed [these](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/GettingStarted.html) instructions to help guide me through the environment set up. 
- In order to zip my files, I downloaded the correct documents from my VSCode. 
- These included the src folder and package.json. 
- After downloading, I was able to compress the files into one zipped file on my computer. 
- I also added the Node version in my package.json as recommended by our instructor,
